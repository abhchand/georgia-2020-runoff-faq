# Georgia 2020 Election Runoff FAQ

Georgia saw an incredible voter turnout this past election, and now it's at the center of another important set of races for the Senate ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

On **Jan 5, 2021** you'll get a chance to vote for the following races:

* David Perdue (R) vs Jon Ossoff (D)
* Kelly Loeffler (R) vs Raphael Warnock (D)

None of these candidates won 50% of the vote in the November election, and by Georgia law a runoff election is held to determine a winner.

# Why Is this so Important?

This race determines the control of the Senate, so whichever way you lean politically it's important that you vote to ensure your desired outcome.

Georgia has also had incredibly poor turnouts for runoffs, so it's that much more important to have a truly representative vote.
